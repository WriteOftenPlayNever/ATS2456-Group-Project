The Cambridge Analytica scandal, as it later came to be called, was a contentious act of cyber deviance, and arguably cybercrime on a national scale. 

Cambridge Analytica itself was a consulting firm that collected the data of millions of Facebook users and used it to create psychological profiles of them through information that they gave voluntarily in quizzes and unwittingly through Facebookâ€™s commercially available data collection. The data was then given in consultation to politically interested parties who would use this to target their advertisement to succeptible people, and to understand their power base more effectively. Some users were paid to answer surveys whose information was then weaponised against them in the form of targeted political advertisement. 

The most insidious element of this system was that information from the user's friends on Facebook was also collected and collated, and used in the same fashion (Afriat et al., 2021). These acts alone could be measured as an act of privacy invasion, or a compromise of civil liberties, however it is the use of this collated data to create targeted political content and advertisement that is the main element of the scandal; particularly the consultation that Cambridge Analytica provided to the Trump campaign during the 2016 United States election.

There are already issues that arise attempting to apply traditional criminological theories to cybercrimes, let alone the blurry line that separates cyber deviance from cyber crimes (especially in cases such as there where no explicit law has been broken but there is measurable harm to the citizenry), so it can be an even greater challenge to analyse actions on such a national scale. Even so, this report will consider the actions of the Cambridge Analytica firm and the fallout thereof through the lenses of Routine Activity Theory, Strain Theory, and Techniques of Neutralisation.
