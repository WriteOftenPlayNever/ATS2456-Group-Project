A predominant issue raised by the Cambridge Analytica scandal was whether cyberspace has become an enabler for criminal activity. This can be analysed using Cohen and Felson’s (1979) Routine Activities Theory (RAT). 

Under RAT, crime occurs due to the presence of three key elements - a suitable target, a motivated offender and the absence of a capable guardian (Cohen & Felson, 1979). RAT suggests that offenders make choices to offend based on a lack of supervision and the suitability of a given target (Leukfeldt & Yar, 2016).

The most prominent link between the Cambridge Analyticia scandal and RAT is the presence of suitable targets. Given the overwhelming growth of online communication, many people provide personal information to online institutions such as Facebook whilst overlooking issues of privacy (Afriat et, al., 2021). These issues are exacerbated by the proximity that can be found between users in an online setting. Cyberspace has allowed users to become connected and thus accessible to offenders without the need for physical closeness, resulting in increased access to suitable targets (Reyns, 2015). As Facebook provides a platform for users to connect globally, the data collected by Cambridge Analyticia from the ‘friends’ of survey participants allowed for victims to be targeted from around the world.  

Similarly, the ability of online environments to provide suitable ‘guardianship’ of user’s data must be considered. Once the scandal was uncovered, it became immediately clear that federal legislation in this area was largely non-existent (Hu, 2020). Had stricter privacy laws and greater governmental enforcement been present, it can be questioned whether Facebook would have demonstrated such a blatant disregard for user’s data. 

Importantly, the scandal also demonstrated that users are largely considered to be responsible for their own cyber safety (Afriat et al., 2021). However, this form of self-guardianship is proven to be less effective at identifying cyber misuse until after breaches have occurred (Reyns, 2011). Consequently, it can be seen that Facebook took advantage of the self-regulation of individual online presences when distributing data to Cambridge Analytica, given that those who were most affected by the data harvesting were those who had not restricted their privacy settings (Hu, 2020).

As such, it is evident that the actions committed by Facebook and Cambridge Analyticia can be analysed using RAT.
